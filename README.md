# Human Detection Using HOG and OpenCV

Objective:
    To demonstrate human detection in a CCTV footage.

step1. To capture the video 

step2. To check if the frame is read successfully.

step3. To resize the frame width .

#to set the instance of Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which sets the difference if gradience between the human and the background.

step4. To detect regions in the footage where human occur.

step5. To get the humans framed under detection.

#Dependencies : 

Python
              
OpenCV

Histogram of Oriented Gradients

Run file 'human_detection.py' to check the detection.

The video that has been taken for reference is file 'humandet_video.mp4'
